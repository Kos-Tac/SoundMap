# SoundMap
The goal of this project is to create 3D maps using the power of music! Two options are available : recording via a mic or passing a sound file to be processed. The useful data is then extracted (pitch and intensity), and is then used to generade a 3D landmass.

# Work in progress
Did the data extraction from sound and texture creation from data. Need to correct mistakes on texture scaling and create a landmass from it.
