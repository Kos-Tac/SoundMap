# SoundMap
The goal of this project is to create 3D maps using the power of music! Two options are available : recording via a mic or passing a sound file to be processed. The useful data is then extracted (pitch and intensity), and is then used to generade a 3D landmass.

# Demo - Sound texture

# Work in progress
Next working on a circular generation for more interesting results,
then on a DOTS implementation using the soundAnalyser.
